#Jan 24th 
today we went over alot of colour basic stuff for websites, i am a bit beind everyone else so i have been working on alot of projects to try to catch up to everyone but seem to still be struggling with online classes. I am finding the course intresting but tough to do still just waiting to kind of get the hang of things as i am very new to all of this. right now we are learning just the bare bones of what goes into a website which is pretty intresting in my opinion you get to see everythin behind a website.

Today we learned how to make 404 pages like the ones when websites crash over overload and mde our own 404 pages in lab which will be good knowlege to have when building future websites for people. we also were intro duced to CSS grid which seems like it will still be easier to do tha java script.

*Today we did paired coding in class, i usually dont like working in groups but i did like working with stephan, i learned alot from him when we were working which was nice because it has been helping my work going forward on whats going on.

*Today we did a group activity looking at the heros of a website, i as paired with stephen and will which is a great group. we looked at devent art for our assigment, it had alot of cool aspects to the website itself and was very user friendly. we were able to do teh assigment really quick because my group knew what they were doing right off the bat and we zoomed thrpugh it which was cool, we also have a guest stuent in today which seems nice she is here to help anyone with coding troubles

*Today we learned about how to do simple animations for our webpages, its kinda complicated but once completey figured out it will be alot better for my final webpage design. we had also gone over hero sections which is the part of the page thats under the search bar.

#Feb 3rd
*Today we did a little bit of java script, it is not as confusing as i thought it was going to be but it will still take alot of time to learn which is okay i still have tons of time. Java script is interesting because it just adds a whole other layer of stuff you can do to your website whhich in the long run will be great.

#Feb 4th
*Today we did math related things in coding, which i very much did not like im not a big math guy personally but it wasnt hard stuff to do so it was all good and no homework related to math so still chilling. Coding is becoming very intertesing because of everything you can do with it and i still dont even know like 10% of what you can actually do.
