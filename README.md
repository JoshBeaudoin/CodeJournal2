today we went over alot of colour basic stuff for websites, i am a bit beind everyone else so i have been working on alot of projects to try to catch up to everyone but seem to still be struggling with online classes. I am finding the course intresting but tough to do still just waiting to kind of get the hang of things as i am very new to all of this. right now we are learning just the bare bones of what goes into a website which is pretty intresting in my opinion you get to see everythin behind a website.

Today we learned how to make 404 pages like the ones when websites crash over overload and mde our own 404 pages in lab which will be good knowlege to have when building future websites for people. we also were intro duced to CSS grid which seems like it will still be easier to do tha java script.

*Today we did a group activity looking at the heros of a website, i as paired with stephen and will which is a great group. we looked at devent art for our assigment, it had alot of cool aspects to the website itself and was very user friendly. we were able to do teh assigment really quick because my group knew what they were doing right off the bat and we zoomed thrpugh it which was cool, we also have a guest stuent in today which seems nice she is here to help anyone with coding troubles
