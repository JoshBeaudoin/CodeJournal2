#Jan 24th 
today we went over alot of colour basic stuff for websites, i am a bit beind everyone else so i have been working on alot of projects to try to catch up to everyone but seem to still be struggling with online classes. I am finding the course intresting but tough to do still just waiting to kind of get the hang of things as i am very new to all of this. right now we are learning just the bare bones of what goes into a website which is pretty intresting in my opinion you get to see everythin behind a website.
